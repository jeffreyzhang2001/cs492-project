However, you realize it is not the best degree for employment so you're also considering Computer Science. You heard there is good job security and you think you are decent at it.

Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like). Where does it come from? Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.",
